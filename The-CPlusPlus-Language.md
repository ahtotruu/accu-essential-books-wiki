This is a much more modern C++ introduction than Bjarne Stroustrup's books. It is STL-first, pointer later introduction. The only drawback, being from 2000 it is not covering C++11 and beyond, but still highly relevant and eye opening for the uninitiated, because of its approach.

The title says it all. If you want to learn or refer to template-based programming in C++ this is the go-to book.
